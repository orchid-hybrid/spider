spider
======

having another go at autoref

This is supposed to work as a backend for NieA. It should be possible to compile a .niea file into a .ref file using the script in NieA and then compile that into a .cexpr (then into c with cexprs) with spider.

* t1 works
* t2 works
* t3 works
* t4 fails

Goal:

1: Get all tests working
2: Get all UFOs working
3: Add refcounting to reclaim unused memory
